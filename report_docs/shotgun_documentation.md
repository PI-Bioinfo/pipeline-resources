# How to interpret the shotgun report
This document describes how to understand the bioinformatics report generated by [Aladdin shotgun pipeline](https://github.com/Zymo-Research/aladdin-shotgun). Most of the plots are taken from the [sample report](https://zymo-research.github.io/pipeline-resources/reports/shotgun_sample_report.html). The sample report was generated using a small number of samples from [this paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35614211). The plots in your report might look a little different.

## Report overview
The bioinformatics report is generated using [`MultiQC`](https://multiqc.info/). There are general instructions on how to use a MultiQC report on [MultiQC website](https://multiqc.info/). The report itself also includes a link to a instructional video at the top of the report. In general, the report has a navigation bar to the left, which allows you to quickly navigate to one of many sections in the report. On the right side, there is a toolbox that allows to customize the appearance of your report and export figures and/or data. Most sections of the report are interactive. The plots will show you the sample name and values when you mouse over them.
